    As dark matter particle signals remain undiscovered and its mass spans over 80 orders of magnitude, both experimental design and theoretical research face challenges. Thus, our team focus on two strategies:

Firstly, we can establish a simplied dark matter model based on the motivation and understanding of particle physics to predict potential signals.  This approach allows for cross-verification with other particle physics experiments and can predict dark matter mass range.  In addition, the allowed parameter space can even suggest a new detection methods.

Secondly, we can improve our knowledge of the standard background--- including astrophyical, particle, or cosmological backgrounds. By engaging observational data with this standard background, we may detect an excess, potentially from dark matter particles. If this excess is real, in addition to the possible DM parameters, it may also help improve our understanding of the standard background.
